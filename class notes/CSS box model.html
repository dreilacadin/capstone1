<!-- CSS Box Model -->

FOR CSS, everything is a BOX!

Each HTML element is either a "block" box or an "inline" box.


<!-- *Avoid vertical padding for inline elements* -->

<!-- Types of positioning  -->
1. Static (Margins/padding)
2. Relative ( original position)
3. Absolute (browser window)
 - Relatively absolute
 	- 1st: find parent to serve as a reference
 	  2nd: put position (absolute, relative, fixed)
 	  3rd: child/descendant should have absolute positioning
 	  4th: feel free to style around

<!-- Floating elements -->
-Block elements always appeared vertically one after another, effectively limiting us to a single-column layout.

-"Floats" let us put block-level elements side-by-side instead of on top of each other.
