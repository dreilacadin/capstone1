CSS - Cascading style sheets

HTML was never intended to contain presentational tags | It was a challenge to make uniform changes
To solve this problem, the W3C (World wide web consorcium) developed CSS
In HTML4, all of the formatiing could be removed from the HTML document and placed in a separate style document called CSS.

Class Selector
.class_name{style: properties;}

Types of selectors

Adjacent sibling selector - +
	- separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent element.

Syntax:
former_element + target_element {
	style:properties;
}

Selectors can be grouped by separating each one with a comma

Example:
p,#test,.test,.box title {style: properties;}
